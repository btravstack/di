/**
 * NOT example code. Do not copy anything out of this file.
 *
 * It is a compile-time test that happens to live beside an example, because
 * what it tests *is* what an example is: a downstream package that uses
 * `@btravstack/di` and **emits its own declarations**. Everything below is a
 * consumer-side shape that `tsconfig.emit.json` has to be able to write into a
 * `.d.ts` — the one thing `tsc --noEmit` on the example proper does not fully
 * exercise, and the thing that was broken.
 *
 * What went wrong when nothing checked this: `PortInstance`'s brand keys are
 * two module-private `unique symbol`s (`ID`/`SERVICE`, plus `MANY` for a set
 * port), and neither `PortClass` nor `ManyPortClass` was exported from the
 * package index. With no name to reach for, the emitter expanded a port class's
 * heritage expression down to those symbols, and **every consumer that exported
 * a port** — the pattern `packages/di/README.md` teaches on its first page —
 * failed with `TS4020: 'extends' clause of exported class 'X' has or is using
 * private name 'ID'`. The three example packages had been papering over it with
 * `declaration: false` in their own tsconfigs, which is why the repo was green
 * while no consumer could build. Those overrides are gone; this file is what
 * replaced them.
 *
 * Three rules that are easy to destroy by tidying:
 *
 *  1. **An unused `@ts-expect-error` here is a failure, not noise.** The fix
 *     for `TS4020` is to make more of the port machinery nameable, and the
 *     cheap version of that — exporting `ID`/`SERVICE`/`MANY` themselves —
 *     makes emit work while quietly destroying the thing the brands exist for:
 *     with the symbols in hand a consumer hand-writes `{ [ID]: "Pool",
 *     [SERVICE]: Shape }` and passes it off as a `Pool`. Measured: it
 *     type-checks. The directives below are the assertion that the symbols are
 *     still out of reach, so a directive going unused is the signal that
 *     someone widened the export surface too far.
 *
 *  2. **The gate compiles this file, it does not merely check it.** Emit-time
 *     diagnostics like `TS4020` are raised by the *declaration emitter*, so
 *     `noEmit` has to be off for the pass to mean anything, and the emitted
 *     output is then fed back through the compiler — a dangling reference in
 *     the output is not an emit-time diagnostic and would otherwise ship. The
 *     re-check names `emit-guards.d.ts` explicitly rather than `index.d.ts`
 *     alone: a file is checked only if it is named or reached by an import from
 *     something named, and **nothing imports this one**. Never add
 *     `--skipLibCheck` to that step; it turns off `.d.ts` checking entirely and
 *     the run exits 0 on broken output.
 *
 *  3. **Both the plain port and the `Port.many` port are load bearing.** They
 *     fail through different brands — `ID`/`SERVICE` against `PortClass`,
 *     and additionally `MANY` against `ManyPortClass` — so a fix that names
 *     only one of the two class types leaves the other broken. Measured: with
 *     just the instance types nameable, the plain port emitted and the set
 *     port still reported `private name 'MANY'`.

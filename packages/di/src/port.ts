 *
 * `PortClass<Id>` covers the open case, where `Service` is still supplied by a

 * Once a factory has applied it, the return type is a class whose instance is a

 * alias is the stop the emitter needs — see `defineConcretePort` in
 * `examples/hexagonal-order-api/src/emit-guards.ts`.
 *
 * The brands themselves stay unexported, so this buys naming, not forgery.
 *
 * This covers a factory *returning* such a port. A module that **exports** one
 * inverts the shape and needs {@link PortInstance} instead — neither name

// constructor cannot do. `AnyPort` instead demands only what a concrete port class
// actually has — a `portId` and a (possibly abstract) no-arg constructor returning
// some `PortInstance` — which every port, generic or concrete, satisfies. `abstract
// new` rather than `new` is what makes a concrete class's constructor assignable
// here at all: a plain `new` signature is invariant in "can this be called with
// `new`", so a concrete class needs the weaker `abstract new` target.
// `any` is the only bound that accepts every concrete port as a constraint; a
// narrower one would reject ports whose service shape is itself generic. Kept
